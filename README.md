## Tp de Synthèse - Ensea in the Shell

### Léonard NAVIZET et Elise CASTAN

#### Question 1

<p> We choose to implement two functions, the first one to display the welcome message and the other one to display the promt message. </p>

#### Question 2

<p> To execute the give command we check whaat we're reading, then thanks to a fork we execute the given command, finally we display the promt. </p>

#### Question 3

<p> We are replacing the fonction execute_cmd from question 2 by execute_cmd_final which allows exiting from the shell with "exit" or ctrl+d .</p>

#### Question 4

<p> To display the exit code we modify the type signature of the previous fonctions because we needed them to return their exit code. </p>

#### Question 5

<p> We are modifying the display and mesuring the execution time. </p>

#### Question 6
